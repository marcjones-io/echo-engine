Dynamic video game engine modeled after Adobe's Starling Engine (see: Angry Birds)

### about:
Echo Engine is a video game engine built from the ground up in Java. Its functionality is modeled after Adobe's Starling engine, providing it sufficient power for just about any sort of 2D game. 

___Echo Engine is very much still a work in progress.___ Its primary purpose is to serve as the foundation of the "Echo" video game: a puzzle platformer. A beta of "Echo" debuted in August 2016 at the University of Virginia to private audience of fellow game developers, that model featured an improved physics engine and animated sprites that I have not yet prepared to be shared.

In thea meantime, I will continue to improve on the engines functionality, & subsequently games experience. I hope to have a posted version of the game up as soon as this semester's work dies down (closer to January).

Here's a screengrab from the game "Echo" built off of my "Echo-Engine":
